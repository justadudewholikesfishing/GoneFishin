### Core principles

- Make fair tokenomics
- Make the airdrop as fair as possible
- The real value of this token is the community - build the right community first, the value will come later
- Open up the project to the public from the very beginning - give everyone a chance to participate in the whole journey, not just the end result!

### Key features

- The airdrop aims to be a real airdrop when tokens land directly in the wallet
- Clean and simple tokenomics: 85% public sale, 15% airdrop
- No VCs, no presales, no tiered fundraising, no "team allocation" or "fund allocation"
- No taxes on transactions
- Renounced contract ownership
- NOT a staking coin!
- Give back to the community via token burns
- Sustainability: the project's will continue even when the last token will be sold off (some would say it will only then begin!)
- Everyone is equal, even the team members have to purchase the coin if they want to participate in the ecosystem - if they believe in the core principles, they know it's worth it!
