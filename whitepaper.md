### Core principles

- Make fair tokenomics
- Make the airdrop as fair as possible
- The real value of this token is the community - build the right community first, the value will come later
- Open up the project to the public from the very beginning - give everyone a chance to participate in the whole journey, not just the end result!

### Key features

- The airdrop aims to be a real airdrop when tokens land directly in the wallet
- Clean and simple tokenomics: 85% public sale, 15% airdrop
- No VCs, no presales, no tiered fundraising, no "team allocation" or "fund allocation"
- No taxes on transactions
- Renounced contract ownership
- NOT a staking coin!
- Give back to the community via token burns
- Sustainability: the project will continue even when the last token will be sold off (some would say it will only then begin!)
- Everyone is equal, even the team members have to purchase the coin if they want to participate in the ecosystem - if they believe in the core principles, they know it's worth it!

# Tokenomics

The total token supply is: 1234567891
Why? Because it is a prime number

You can notice from the diagram that there are no angel investors, VCs, no "reserves for the team", nobody bought the token on pre-sale. The only way to obtain the token is on the open market or via the airdrop. This has the added benefit of no price-pressure from "early-investors".

## Problem:

Most new projects struggle between funding the project, and making the token holders happy.
If the project funders are selling too much tokens too fast, it will suppress the price, which results in a sluggish price action, which scares away potential buyers, which in turn force the project to sell even more tokens.

To counterbalance this effect various vesting schedules and locking-periods are introduced. This usually delays the problem, but does not solve it entirely.

Both the funders and the token holders are interested in the same thing: a successful project and a positive price-action.

## Solution:

The unique value proposition of Gone Fishin' toke is to solve this problem differently:

Instead of time-locking the token-supply, we will price-lock it:
Portion of the token supply will be sold on the free market when the price reaches a certain treshold.

This way, if the project is successful, it will increase the price, and more tokens will be unlocked for sale. We fail to build a community, the price will lag behind, but there will be no token sales to further suppress the price.




## Why this is not a staking token?


# Airdrop

# Revenue share

Buyback and burn

# Why should anyone invest in a token instead of the pase layer?

# Donations

# Main goal

The ultimate goal is to make a community-driven coin
