## The Gone Fishin' project officially starts at 1st of May 2024. If you you are here, you are waaay yoo early!

## The whitepaper is subject to change, read it as a pre-alpha version!

Gone Fishin' | The Token of the Free Folk | Built on Solana | 100% memecoin 0% BS

Gone Fishin’ is not a token it is a community. It is a state of mind. It is about the freedom of choice. It is for the people who one day decide to get up from their desks, take back control of their lives, and do whatever the heck they want!

As for me, I just want to go fishin'…

### Core principles

- The real value of this token is the community - build the right community first, the value will come later
- Fairness: fair launch, fair tokenomics, fair airdrop
- Sustainability: the project have to live on, even when the last token will be sold (some would say it will only then begin!)
- Open up the project to the public from the very beginning - give everyone a chance to participate in the whole journey, not just the end result!

### Key features

- The airdrop aims to be a real airdrop when tokens land directly in your wallet
- Clean and simple tokenomics: price-locked tokens, 85% public sale, 15% airdrop
- No VCs, no presales, no tiered fundraising, no "team allocation" and no "fund allocation". The tokens are available for sale from the very beginning on the open market
- No taxes on transactions
- Renounced contract ownership (after we make it public, we cannot mint more coins or freeze the existing ones: verifiable on blockchain)
- NOT a staking coin!
- Giving back to the community via token burns
- Everyone is equal, even the team members have to donate or purchase the coin if they want to participate in the ecosystem - if they believe in the core principles, they know it's worth it!

# Tokenomics

The total token supply is: 1234567891
Why? Because it is a prime number

Token contract address (CA): https://solscan.io/token/CwoUyDERehjuMVuPQdWFLrYKXahFWDxeoJC2gxNjtW1Z 


MENTION  THE DONATIONS!



There are no angel investors, VCs, no "reserves for the team", nobody bought the token on pre-sale. The only way to obtain the token is on the open market or via the airdrop. This has the added benefit of no price-pressure from "early-investors".

The price of the token is calculated in Solana (SOL) instead of USDC. Remember the core values: we are in crypto to distance ourselves from the fiat system. At the end of the day we want to have more crypto, not more fiat.

## Problem:

Most new projects struggle between funding the project, and making the token holders happy.
If the project funders are selling too much tokens too fast, it will suppress the price, which results in a sluggish price action, which scares away potential buyers, which in turn force the project to sell even more tokens.

To counterbalance this effect various vesting schedules and locking-periods are introduced. This usually delays the problem, but does not solve it entirely.

Both the funders and the token holders are interested in the same thing: a successful project and a positive price-action.

## Solution:

The unique value proposition of Gone Fishin' toke is to solve this problem differently:

Instead of time-locking the token-supply, we will price-lock it:
Portion of the token supply will be sold on the free market when the price reaches a certain treshold.

This way, if the project is successful, it will increase the price, and more tokens will be unlocked for sale. We fail to build a community, the price will lag behind, but there will be no token sales to further suppress the price.

This can be mathematically defined in a simple and elegant way:

token_price_in_SOL = 0.0001 ^ (token_supply_percent / 37)

Why 37 you ask? Excellent question! Because it is a prime number!

Look at the following diagram for easier explanation:
[image of linear diagram]

This is the same diagram in the logarythmic format:
[image of logarytmic diagram]

** The diagrams DOES NOT represent the price action, it just illustrates what percentage of the token-supply will be unlocked if the token reach a certain price! **

Let's look at some real-world examples:
The initial token price will be 0.0001 SOL per 1 FISHIN . That means for every SOL you will receive 10.000 FISHIN tokens.

Once the price hit 0.0002 per 1 FISHIN token, approximately 10.8% percent of the token supply will be in the circulation.

Once the price does 10X from the initial price 0.001 SOL per 1 FISHIN or 1000 FISHIN per SOL, exactly 37% of the total token supply will be in the circulation!! (Remember that 37 from the formula? This is how the price will effect how much of the total token supply will be sold.)

The theoretical maximum price is 0.02 SOL per 1 FISHIN, or 50 FISHIN per SOL, at which point approximately 85% of the token supply will be sold. Remember, 15% of the token supply will be airdropped during the project. 

At this point 100% of the token supply will be in circulation, and the project will be taken over by the community!

## Donations

If you like what you read so far, consider donating for the project!
Since donation is a leap of faith, we will handsomely reward every donator during the airdrop.
To avoid spam transaction, the minimum donation for the airdrop reward is 0.01 SOL.
ALL of the donations will be added to liquidity pool at the start of the project (1st of May, 2024)

## Liquidity pools

In an ideal world, the community would provide the liquidity pools for a community driven project. This would prevent rug-pulls and liquidity drains.

Unfortunately, this is not an ideal world and at the beginning, the project will not be driven by the community.

BUT it does not mean that we cannot guide things in the right direction:

At the beginning we will provide a really-small initial liquidity. This way every larger buy will cause an up-swing, which in turn unlocks a portion of the tokens which will be sold on the open market. The proceedings from these sales will be added to the liquidity pool.

Since it is very lucrative provide a larger portion of a small liquidity pool, we assume that more and more initial buyers will become liquidity providers. We have a very concrete idea how much assets a healthy liquidity pool holds. We will slowly reduce the participation in the liquidity pool. By the time the community takes over the healthy portion of the liquidity pool, our participation will become virtually meaningless.

## Why this is not a staking token?

We know that is is trendy to make a staking token. And we like SOME of the staking cryptos (for example Solana), where you use a portion of your assets to trust a validator who secures the network.

** BUT **

For *some* of tokens (probably the majority), staking is nothing else, just a unnecessary inflation. Most of us came to crypto to avoid the inflation of the fiat currency. To replace fiat with an asset which have higher inflation than the fiat currency itself is generally not a smart idea.

Not to mention the 20+ day unstaking periods in the market where time is usually measured in minutes.

Our token will be strictly deflationary, by introducing the buyback and bur mechanism.


# Airdrop

# Buyback and Burn (A.K.A. Revenues Share)

Did I mention that the true value behind this token is the community?

Some people know it very well. There will be times when we partner up with other crypto projects (airdrops, collaborations, cross-promotions).

We have to find a way to give back to community. Since revenue share is still a legal grey-zone. To make it simple: if someone directly shares a revenue with the token holders, it fulfills the same function as a dividend, in which case the tokens fulfill the same function as shares, which falls into category as securities. (We are closely watching what will happen with Uniswap in the future!)

Instead, we will use portion of the revenue to buy back the token on the open market, and then burn it.

The effects will be two fold: 1st there is a buying pressure on the open market, 2nd the total token supply will be shirinking.

This way we just introduced deflation!

# Why should anyone invest in a token instead of the pase layer?

Let us compare the performance of 2 successful memecoins on Solana blockchain VS Solana itself:

# Riks warning

Since the FISHIN price is quoted in Solana, there is a multiplication effect in dollar-terms: if the price of the Solana goes up, the smaller-cap altcoins (just like this one) on solana ecosystem gain value compared to Solana. Comparatively: if the Solana price declines, people lose interest in the smaller altcoins in the ecosystem, so they will (usually) fall in terms of Solana. This will result in wild price-swings on the both side. Please trade with caution.

Non of us in the team are financial advisors, but consider the following:
- never invest more than what you afford to lose
- don't trade with leverage (especially not on crypto)
- always self-custody of your crypto

# Long-term goals

The ultimate goal is to make a community-driven coin
Collaborations
Airdrops
Launching our own launchpad
Selling real-life product in established stores, getting discounts if people pay with FISHIN'

We have so many ideas, and this project can be so much then just a memcoin, hope you will help us achieve them!
